# Hospital Emergency Room Dashboard (Interactive Dashboard using Power BI)
## Project Objective
The aim of this project is to develop a comprehensive Hospital Emergency Room Analysis Dashboard to provide actionable insights into emergency room performance. This tool enables stakeholders to make data-driven decisions to optimize patient management and enhance service efficiency.

## Dataset used
- <a href="https://github.com/c0mmander63/Hospital-Emergency-Dashboard---Power-BI/blob/main/Hospital%20ER_Data.csv">Dataset</a>

## Key Metrics (KPIs)
1. Number of Patients:
- Total patients visiting the ER daily.
- Trends over time to identify peak days or seasonal variations.
2. Average Wait Time:
- Average time before patients are attended by medical
professionals.
- Highlights operational bottlenecks on high-traffic days.
3. Patient Satisfaction Score:
- Daily satisfaction scores to evaluate service quality.
- Correlation of dips with operational challenges or high patient
volume.
4. Number of Patients Referred:
- Count of patients referred to specific departments.
- Analysis of departments with high referral rates for resource
allocation.
5. Admission Status:
- Distribution of admitted vs. non-admitted patients.
6. Patient Demographics:
- Analysis by age, gender, and race to understand ER user trends.
7. Timeliness:
- Percentage of patients attended within 30 minutes.
8. Time Analysis:
- Patient volume by day and hour.
